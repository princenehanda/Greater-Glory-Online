          Salvation is Godâ€™s greatest gift to humanity. To receive Jesus is to welcome
          the very life of God into your spirit. Itâ€™s not about religion or trying to
          be good enough â€” itâ€™s about accepting the finished work of Christ, who died
          for your sins and rose again so you may live in righteousness.

          When you confess Jesus as Lord, His divine life replaces the old nature of sin,
          and you are born again into a new creation. From that moment, you are no longer
          separated from God but brought into fellowship with Him, filled with His love,
          peace, and purpose. This is the beginning of a beautiful walk in Christ, where
          His Word and Spirit guide you into victory every day.

      <h2 class="section-title">Prayer of Salvation</h2>
      <p class="section-description">
        If you want to make Jesus Christ the Lord of your life, say this prayer aloud and mean it with all your heart:
      </p>

      <div class="prayer-box">
        <p>
          O Lord God, I come to You in the Name of Jesus.
          <br>I believe that Jesus Christ is Your Son.
          <br>I believe He died for my sins and that You raised Him from the dead for my justification.
          <br>Your Word says in <strong class="verse">Romans 10:9</strong>, <em>"If you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved."</em>
          <br>I declare that Jesus Christ is the Lord of my life from this day.
          <br>By my faith in Him, I receive eternal life into my spirit.
          <br>I am born again! I am a child of God now.
          <br>Thank You, Lord, for saving my soul! Hallelujah!
        </p>
