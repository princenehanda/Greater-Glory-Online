            <div class="faith-points">
                <p><strong>1. The Holy Scriptures:</strong> We believe the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and authoritative Word of God, the complete revelation of His will for the salvation of mankind, and the divine and final authority for all Christian faith and life.</p>
                <p><strong>2. The One True God:</strong> We believe there is one God, eternally existent in three persons: God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit. He is the Creator and Sustainer of all things, and He is infinitely perfect in all His attributes.</p>
                <p><strong>3. The Lord Jesus Christ:</strong> We believe in the deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His sinless life, in His miracles, in His vicarious and atoning death, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, and in His personal future return to this earth in power and glory to rule.</p>
                <p><strong>4. The Holy Spirit:</strong> We believe in the person and work of the Holy Spirit, who indwells every believer, empowering them for a life of holiness, service, and witnessing. We believe in the baptism with the Holy Spirit and the operation of the gifts of the Spirit as promised in the Scriptures.</p>
                <p><strong>5. The Salvation of Man:</strong> We believe that all mankind is lost and sinful and that salvation is a gift from God, made possible by grace through faith in the finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross. We believe that regeneration by the Holy Spirit is absolutely essential for personal salvation.</p>
